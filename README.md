# Predicting-the-Claim-Approval-Process
1. Project Description A Auto Insurance dataset was given to make a Claim  Approval prediction. Currently, In approval process customers first apply for the Claim  and after that company validates the customer's eligibiity based on different parameters asked in Claim  approval form. These parameters are 'ClaimID', 'AGMID', 'LOB', 'State', 'ProgramCode', 'PlanCode',   'VehicleMake', 'VehicleModel', 'VehicleYear', 'TermMonth', 'TermMiles',  'ComponentCode', 'ComponentSet', 'ContractStatus and others. It is a Binary Classification problem where we have to predict whether a Claim would be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to predict the discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s).In this project we will identify the best algorithm by comparing the results of different classification algorithms for Claim  approval prediction where based on the parameters applicant will get there  approved/denied . 

2. The Problem Statement: A company wants to know and automate the process that which customers Claims should be approved or denied.
